title: ðŸ–¥ Platforms and tools
description: What are the digital tools we use to work
---
Among [Scambi Festivalâ€™s fundamental values](https://scambi.org/manifesto) there is the one of preferring ethical digital tools, preferrably hosted on our own servers. For each service and platform an account is created for every association member.

* [**scambi.org**](https://scambi.org) is the official _Scambi Festival_ website
* [_**Nuvola**_](https://nuvola.scambi.org) is our cloud (check its own section in the Manual)
* **Telegram** is our main communication platform. ALL of Scambi communications take place there.
  * On _**Scambi STAFF**_ the general conversation takes place
  * On _**Scambi IMPORTANT**_ main announcements are sent, while follow-ups and conversations must take place on _STAFF_.
  * On _**Scambidee**_ anyone of us can share any sort of idea
  * Each [team](../staff/Teams.md) has its own group chat
* [**Cubbit**](https://web.cubbit.io) is our archive: here are saved all of the media from every edition.
* [**Buttondown**](Buttondown.md) is the service we use to send [_Scambi Epistolari_](https://epistulae.scambi.org), Scambiâ€™s [**newsletter**](../Communication/Newsletter.md).
* [**GitBook**](https://gitbook.com) is the platform you are using right now to read _The Manual_. To contribute to its content, look among _Scambi IMPORTANT_ pinned messages.
* [**Canva**](https://canva.com) is mainly used by the [Dragonflies](../staff/Teams.md#dragonflies) to produce our social media posts.
* On [**images.tommi.space**](https://images.tommi.space/index?/category/scambi-festival) are temporarily hosted all the pictures (exclusively stills, not videos) of all editions of Scambi. They are organized by kind of event and activity. The software used is [Piwigo](https://piwigo.org).

For any technical problem, please do not hesitate to fill out [this form](https://nuvola.scambi.org/apps/forms/qtqRxnSic6fTpmKk) and get in touch with the [Silicon](../staff/Teams.md#silicon) team.
