title: üìã Deck
description: The tool we use to organize virtually anything
---
Thanks to the [_**Deck**_](https://nuvola.scambi.org/apps/deck) we can easily organize and manage any task.

Within the Deck, there are different _**boards**_; within each board there can be several _**lists**_, and all lists are composed by _**cards**_.

The specifics of how each board is organized vary according to the purpose of the board and the team exploiting it, but there are some common basic features.

## Card features

![After clicking on a card, you see this](https://x.scambi.org/assets/manual/card.jpg)

* **Tags** can be assigned to cards, e.g. to mark their status.
* One or more user can be **assigned to a card**, meaning it is their job to get it done.
* A card can have a **deadline**
* Cards can be **grouped** into ‚Äúprojects‚Äù: they can be linked to any other file within Nuvola, so that it is easier to retrieve documents that are all related to the same thing
* Each card has a **description** field, supporting [Markdown syntax](../markdown.md#syntax)

### Attachments

It is not unusual that a card refers to the creation of a post. In such a case, it is useful to exploit the feature allowing you to attach files to the card. In this case, it would be the image of the post

!!! warning	
	<mark class='red'>Do not to upload files directly</mark>, but rather to place them within a folder on _Nuvola_ and _then_ attach them to a card.

### Comments

Even though it is more intuitive and easy to discuss about stuff on our groupchats, it becomes very hard to effectively follow a discussion when it is about 10 things (cards) at the same time. This is why it is important to try and use **card comments**. It is also possible to tag users, so that tehy are notified and they can look at the conversation. (It works like this for every file in _Nuvola_, too)
