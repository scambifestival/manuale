description: What is and how to use Scambi‚Äôs cloud software
---
_Nuvola_ (literally ‚Äúcloud‚Äù in Italian) is <mark>Scambi Festival‚Äôs self-hosted cloud</mark>. It is based on a software called [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com) ([**download the app**](https://nextcloud.com/install)!), and it works like Google Drive (ü§Æ). Nextcloud is awesome also because it offers several extensions which facilitate our [workflow](/workflow/).

* Thanks to the [_**Deck**_](deck.md) we can manage any project and any of its specific tasks.
* On [_**Passwords**_](https://nuvola.scambi.org/apps/passwords) are saved all of the credentials for every account we have.
* The [**Calendar**](https://nuvola.scambi.org/apps/calendar) contains all of the Scambi meetings and planned activities.
* Thanks to [_**Forms**_](https://nuvola.scambi.org/apps/forms) we can create forms, like on Google Forms.
* We use _Collabora Office_ ([**download the app**](https://www.collaboraoffice.com/solutions/collabora-office-android-ios)!) to collaboratively edit documents (it works like Google Docs)
