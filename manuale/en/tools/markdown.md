## What is it?

Wikipedia is the perfect source to understand the meaning of Markdown:

> Markdown is a lightweight markup language made of a simple syntax designed to be converted into HTML and into many other formats \[â€¦\]. It is often used to format README file, to write messages in discussion's forum and to create formatted text by using a simple text editor. \~ [_Markdown_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), Wikipedia

## What it is used for?

We use it in order to format the content of scambi.org and our newsletter, along with many other cases in which it is less noticeable.

## How to use it

It is sufficient to start a research online in order to understand the most suitable way to write by using Markdown, because it is quite subjective. The easiest editor is [Typora](https://typora.io). However, we can use the default editor of _Nuvola_, which is simple and works perfectly fine, in order to modify whatever we want without leaving our wonderful cloud.

## **Syntax**

The Markdown syntax is very easy, but some practice is needed in order to master it. Hereafter some resources:
