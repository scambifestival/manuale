## Content

Many different tables exist on _Pino_. Each one of them has a specific role. In the previous tutorial the roles of the tables and the data entry criteria and cataloguing of data are not specified in details.

* in [_Relazioni_](https://baserow.io/database/22288/table/58822) all Scambi's interactions with people or external institutions are being written.
	* each type of relationship, even if not successful, should be put into this table .
	* if a relationship is renewed for more than just one edition, the **`stato`** field would refer to the **latest edition**.
* in _Programma `year_edition`_ (ex. [_Programma 2022_](https://baserow.io/database/22288/table/58806)) all the **confermed** activities for a specific edition are collected.
	* the name should not mislead: in Programma each type of collaboration related to edition at issue should be collected, not only things taking place physically.
* in _Programma `year_edition`_ (ex. [_Persone 2022_](https://baserow.io/database/22288/table/61708)) all the people taking part in the edition in question, no matter their role, are collected.
