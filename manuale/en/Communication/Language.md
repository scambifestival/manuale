# 🤌 Language

Following the principles of inclusiveness and mutual respect on which Scambi is based, the language we use for our communications, both formal and informal, is _**inclusive**_** Italian** (or inclusive English).

!!! info
	Actually, the term “inclusive” is not inclusive at all (Sabrina in particular despises it), as including someone means that you are automatically excluding someone else, however, we keep using “inclusive” since it is the most understandable and straightforward term.

Practically, this means using **they/them** when referring to a general person, but it doesn't stop there.

The UN general guidelines for gender-inclusive language are a good starting point: [https://www.un.org/en/gender-inclusive-language/guidelines.shtml](https://www.un.org/en/gender-inclusive-language/guidelines.shtml)

## Terminology

* “Lab” is always to be preferred over “Laboratory”
* "Labber" is the facilitator of a Lab
* "Staff" is the team that organises Scambi all year round
* "International volunteers" are the young people from all over Europe who come help us exclusively during the festival week
* "Participants" is always to be preferred over public, visitors and so on
