---
Anyone can join the crew of pragmatist dreamers of which Scambi Festival is made. However, in order to do so correctly, there is a simple, but important procedure to follow.

1. **Contact** someone who is already part of the staff, if you do not know anyone, it is sufficient to write to any of the contects of Scambi.
2. **Choose the team** that is the most suitable for you according to your interests and competences, contact the leader and enter the team for a **trial period** of two or three weeks. During the trial period the _new entry_:
	* is considered effectively part of the team, but it is not supervised while accomplishing every task;
	* is free to change team or to join more than one at the same time;
	* in case of any doubt the _new entry_ could ask to its own _Team Leader_;
	* it is free to take part to all meetings, about which the _new entry_ should be informed by the _Team Leader_;
3. At the end of the trail period, the _Team Leader_ will connect the _new entry_ with the Turtles team, which will proceed with his/her[ registration. ](https://app.gitbook.com/o/cLtq3Lr1Q7ZuGs2GR74S/s/9kMtZ3VKQeBtf2b4r1BJ/)
