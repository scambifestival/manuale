While Cubbit is perfect to have a redundant and reliable backup of heavy files, it lacks the possibility of easily previewing and sorting them, as well as properly applying filters while searching.

Luckily enough, the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org) perfectly solves this problem: it allows us to upload an unlimited amount of media of any size, as long as it is public domain.

In order to make Internet Archive backups actually useful, a lot of metadata should be added to each item being uploaded, so that finding pictures and videos about what you are looking for is quick and simple.

Fill the information according to [this reference CSV file](https://x.scambi.org/scambi-archive.org-reference.csv).

### Custom

To improve filtering specifically related to Scambi Festival stuff, here are some extra custom metadata fields. Most of the same information should be added to the subjects, but it is useful to have dedicated fields anyways.

* **`what`**: kind of activity; for example, it could be `Backstage`, `Allestimento collettivo`, `Lab`, `Pinolo`, Dissolvenze, `SquiLibristi`‚Ä¶
* **`pinolo`**: if it is a [Pinolo](../../format/pinoli.md), what Pinolo is it?
* **`lab`**: if it is a [Lab](../../format/lab.md), what Lab is it?
* **`location_tag`**: name of the location; for example, it could be `Piazza Santa Brigida`, `Piazzetta dei Ferri`, `Il Buco`, `La Ciotola`, `Via Tapoletti`‚Ä¶ a complete list of the locations is [in this table](https://pino.scambi.org/database/61/table/322), on [Pino](../pino.md)
* **`relations`**: name of the entity hosting this activity, consistent with the Relation database on Pino
* **`rating`**: set it as Cool for items that are particularly nice, and as Best of for items that are perfect to narrate the festival. Note that ‚ÄúBest of‚Äù is a subset of ‚ÄúCool‚Äù: all ‚ÄúBest of‚Äù items are ‚ÄúCool‚Äù, but not all ‚ÄúCool‚Äù items are ‚ÄúBest of‚Äù.
* **`cubbit_path`**: the path to this item in [Cubbit](https://web.cubbit.io)
