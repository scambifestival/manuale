title: üíæ Storage management
description: How we manage the overwhelming amount of Scambi Festival‚Äôs media
---
During any of Scambi Festival‚Äôs events, a lot of photos and videos are shot. In order for them to be actually useful, they need to be <mark>properly stored, sorted, selected and tagged</mark>: it should be quick, simple and easy to find what you are looking for, and not wasting time going through thousands of pictures waiting to stumble upon the right one.

To accomplish this task, we engineered a particular storage management system that grants us some important features.

* **Redundancy** ‚Äî above all, no file could ever risk being lost. We keep multiple copies of our data in different places and using different technologies.
* **Discoverability** ‚Äî all media are properly selected, sorted and labeled. It should be clear what an image or a video is about just by reading its file name.
* **Remote** access ‚Äî most of the Scambi Festival people meet each other at most once a year. It is critical that we all have access to our media and data regardless of where we are.

## Workflow

!!! danger "Be careful‚ùóÔ∏è"
	The following process is cumbersome and quite stressful by itself, but it can easily turn into a nightmare if the following precautions are not followed during the event:
	* Ensuring that <mark>date, time and time zone are **correct** and **consistent**</mark> across all cameras
	* Store media in <mark>one folder for each **creator** and **media type**</mark> (videos, photos/RAW, photos/JPG). No need to divide them further, everything can be done in post-production, thanks to metadata.

1. During each event, everything that is shot has to be backed up (at least) daily on (at least) to local hard drives.
2. When the event finishes, usually the hard disks owners part ways and they bring their devices with them (since our associations owns none, so far)
3. In a synchronized effort, those who have the hard disks should [select, sort, tag, and edit the event‚Äôs pictures, using digiKam](./#digikam).
4. Once everything is properly arranged, ther whole digiKam database folder is uploaded to our [Cubbit](cubbit.md).
5. Lastly, a copy of all the media is to be [uploaded on the Internet Archive](./#internet-archive).

	Naturally, the process above requires a lot of time and work: it necessarily has to be carried out in different moments, among which it is easy to get lost, even if it is all handled by the same person.

It is critical for <mark>the status of the backup to be **logged** and kept up to date</mark> [**here**](https://nuvola.scambi.org/f/255130).

### Labels and names

In order to make clear the status of a specific folder, let‚Äôs use these naming conventions:

* Add `ARCHIVE.ORG TOSAVE` to the folder/file name if it has not been backed up to the Internet Archive yet
* Add `NOT_COMPLETE` to the file/folder name if its content has to be completely uploaded/stored/sorted
