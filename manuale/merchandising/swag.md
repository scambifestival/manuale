Producing swag differs from printing on paper because it requires more advanced tools and techniques that local producers usually do not offer at an accessible price. Check out the [history](history.md) to understand how we managed this in the past.

## Printing options

### Screen printing

[Screen printing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_printing) (_serigrafia_) consists in building a frame with a shape and then a uniform color fills the different levels of shapes, constituting multiple layers of paint. The attributes of screen printing are several.

* It is **slightly more durable** with respect to digital printing.
* It **costs relatively more** than digital printing, since a custom frame must be created for each graphic. Nevertheless, this could become an advantage since the same frame (the same illustration to be printed) <mark>can be conserved and re-used</mark>.
* Being the result of a fixed structure, screen printing size cannot change, therefore, for instance it cannot be resized according to the size of a shirt.
* The borders of the frame are precise and clear-cut. Therefore, screen printing <mark>cannot print shades</mark> and it <mark>requires</mark> <mark>**vector images**</mark>.

### Digital printing

Digital printing is the most straightforward: an image is printed on a shirt.

* Its quality and durability depend on the materials but they are usually worse than screen printing
* On an average, it is cheaper than screen printing.
* It is the most adaptable, resizable and it can print shades.
